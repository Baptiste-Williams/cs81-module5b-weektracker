### Were your predictions accurate?

Yeah, they were pretty much on point. I figured playing video games would be the most fun, and it was. 
I also thought the stuff I did in the evening would be more enjoyable, and the numbers backed that up. 
I was right that most of my time went to school and work stuff too.

### What surprised you about your week?

I didn’t realize how much time I actually spent on school work. Also,
meetings didn’t feel worth the time — low enjoyment for how long they were. 
One thing that stood out was how working out didn’t take much time but still felt really good.

### Which higher-order function was most useful and why?

.reduce() was super helpful for figuring out totals and averages. But I also liked making my own filter 
functions — they helped me find patterns in my week that I wouldn’t have noticed just by 
looking at the data.
